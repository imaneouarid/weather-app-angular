- [Angular](https://angular.io/) is a front-end web framework built by Google. It allows developers to build a single-page applications modeled around a *model-view-controller* (MVC) or *model-view-viewmodel*(MVVM) software architectural pattern. This architecture divides applications into different, but connected parts allowing for parallel development. Following this pattern, Angular splits its different components into the respective parts of a web application. Its components manage the data and logic that pertain to that component, display the data in its respective view, and adapts or controls the view based on the different messages that it receives from the rest of the app.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a front-end library that helps developers build responsive websites (sites that adapt to different devices), quickly and effectively. It makes use of a grid system that divides each page into twelve columns, which ensures that the page maintains its correct size and scale no matter what device itâ€™s being viewed on.
